# Instructions

Create a JavaScript function called `checkAge` that takes an age (`int`) as a parameter and returns a message based on the age range.

- If age is **less than 18**, display `You are under 18.`
- If the age is **between 18 and 65 years** (inclusive), display `You are an adult.`
- If the age is **greater than 65 years**, display `You are senior.`

Examples:

```
checkAge(15);   // Affiche "Vous êtes mineur."
checkAge(30);   // Affiche "Vous êtes majeur."
checkAge(75);   // Affiche "Vous êtes senior."
```
