# Instructions

Your task is to use SASS to style the list in the following way with the `styles.scss` file:

1. Apply a blue text **color** (`#007bff`) to all list items using a variable (`$blue`);
2. Add an inner **spacing** of 10 pixels to the left of the list items;
3. Give each list item **a bottom margin** of 15 pixels.

Once the modifications to the `styles.scss` file are complete, don't forget to **compile** this same file in the shell using the following command: `sass style.scss style.css`.

Then check that the blue color is applied to each item in the list.
