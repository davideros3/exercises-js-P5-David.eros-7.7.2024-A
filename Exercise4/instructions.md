# Instructions

Apply CSS styles to the HTML file:

1. Set a different background **color** for each element:
   - `header`: `#FFCC99`,
   - `main`: `#E6F2FF`,
   - `aside` `#B3D9FF`:,
   - `footer`: `#99CC99` );
2. Make **bold** and **center** the title text in the header;
3. Add a **margin** of 20 pixels around the main section;
4. Use **Flexbox** to arrange the sidebar on the left and the main content on the right (`aside: flex 1` and `section: flex 3`);
5. Add a 1 pixel **border** around the sidebar and footer, with a gray border color (#CCC);
6. Add a **shadow** to the header and footer to make them stand out.
