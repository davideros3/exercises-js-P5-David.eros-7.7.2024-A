# Instructions

Create an **HTML page** for a simple website with a **navigation** bar at the top of the page. The navigation bar should contain links to different sections of the page: *Home, About, Services and Contact*. You will use the `<ul>` tag. When a user **clicks** on a link, the page should scroll to the corresponding section.
