# Instructions

You have received an existing website that displays correctly on **desktop screens**, but does not scale well on **mobile devices**. Your task is to add CSS styles to make the website responsive and mobile friendly (with a maximum screen size of `768px`).

1. **Analyze** the existing HTML structure and identify which parts of the website need to be adapted for mobile devices.
2. Use **media queries**s in CSS to **define** styles specific to small screens (max 768px):
   - the main title must have a 20px font
   - navigation elements must be displayed in a single column and be centered

> If you have difficulties, you can refer to the chapter [Set media queries for different devices](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/5295881-create-web-page-layouts-with-css/5341491-set-media-queries-for-different-devices) of the course Create Web Page Layouts With CSS
